    "long_description": "## Never waste time on shipping inquiries again\nLet AI and shipping status data handle the work.\n\nPAQATO is a leading solution for post-purchase communication and shipping intelligence. With our Zendesk integration, we transform your customer service into a high-speed support engine by combining real-time tracking with smart AI response drafts.\n\nWhile traditional tools only display data, PAQATO actively helps you process it. Our AI Agent analyzes incoming tickets and provides ready-to-use response drafts based on shipping information. This allows your team to resolve shipment inquiries with just a few clicks, maintaining full control while significantly reducing manual effort.\n\n### Key Benefits:\n* **AI Response Suggestions (AI Agent):** Automatically receive precise response drafts for shipping inquiries. Review, click, and send – no manual typing required.\n* **Smart Shipment History:** View the current status and full tracking history of all customer orders directly within the Zendesk ticket. No more tab-hopping to carrier websites.\n* **Massive Efficiency Gains:** Save an average of 5 minutes per ticket and radically reduce your support costs.\n\n--- \n\n### Human-in-the-Loop AI:\nWe believe in the power of AI as an assistant, not a replacement. The PAQATO AI Agent generates suggestions, but no messages are sent automatically. Your agents always retain the final say, ensuring the highest service quality with every response.\n\n### How it works:\n1. **Identify:** When a ticket is opened, the app automatically identifies the customer's order.\n2. **Display:** The current shipping status and history are displayed instantly.\n3. **Draft:** The AI Agent provides a tailored response draft based on the tracking data.\n4. **Resolve:** Your customer service reviews the draft, clicks \"Use response,\" and the ticket is resolved.\n\n*Join over 1,000 retailers who have already made 15 million customers happy with PAQATO.*\n\n### Data & Privacy\nThis app accesses the following Zendesk data: ticket ID, requester email address, and ticket conversation content. This data is sent to PAQATO servers (moni.paqato.com, api.paqato.com) to retrieve shipment tracking information and generate AI response suggestions. PAQATO stores ticket-related data only for the duration needed to process requests and improve AI suggestion quality. No Zendesk data is shared with third parties. For full details, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.paqato.com/datenschutz).",
